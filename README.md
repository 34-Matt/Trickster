# Tricksters

Wanted to make a fun discord bot for my friends and I.
From there, the Trickster was born.

### Setup

To activate the bot, a bot activate code needs to be created
from the [discord development page](https://discordapp.com/developers).
Once the bot application is created, take the activation token and save it
to a text file named "token.txt".

## Cogs

### Japanese

Since I have been learning Japanese, I wanted the bot to help me learn.
For those who do not have a Japanese keyboard (such as myself),
this bot is able to convert romanji to hiragana.
